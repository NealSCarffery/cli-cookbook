A cookbook for using command line tools to do everyday job.

In every day job, you often encounter various types of repetitive tasks, such as renaming files, finding texts, processing texts and so on. These tasks take a lot of time doing manually using UI applications. This book aims to leverage the power of the command line tools to make your job less tedious and more enjoyable.

This book presents "recipes" for preparing or accomplishing particular, specific tasks. Each recipes contains a "Problem" statement and a "Solution" section. The solution section will list one or several best ways to accomplish the task that the author knows of.

The recipes are ordered randomly.

This book is a work in progress.
